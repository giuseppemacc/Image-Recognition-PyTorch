# Image-Recognition-PyTorch

**Description**

this neural network allows to distinguish two different patterns of images returning 0 or 1

to change the pattern of the images to be recognized, it is necessary to change the images in the DataSet and retrain the neural network

**Pattern 0**
![plot](./readme_images/example2)
this image will return 0

**Pattern 1**
![plot](./readme_images/example1)
this image will return 1
